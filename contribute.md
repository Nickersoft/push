# Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the future development of Push, we'd love your help! If you're
a developer eager who's eager to hop on your next open source contribution, 
[check out our open GitHub issues](https://github.com/Nickersoft/push/issues) or 
[read the contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Nickersoft/push/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to fix existing issues or add your own features. If you're more of a "money talks" sort of
person, feel free to make a PayPal contribution and buy [the guy who created this](http://tylernickerson.com)
a coffee. He isn't currently working a full-time job so he has the time to give back to the open source community...
so every dollar counts &#128512;.
